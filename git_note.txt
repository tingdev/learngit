Linus

git init
git status
git log
git reflog	# all operation logs, it's useful when you want to reset to a LATER revision

git add xx	# add to stage

# if already add to unstage, reset HEAD will unstage it.
git reset HEAD file 	# reset file in the stage to the HEAD of local repo.
			# NOTE: if file is modified and add to unstage, then file would be unstaged, the modification WON'T lost!

git commit -m "ccc"  	# commit from stage to local repo

# if already commit to local repo. use reset commit id.   check commit id with git log.  this would unstage it.
git reset --hard commit_id		# roll back, id can be  HEAD~1 (ie. 1 revision before HEAD), or the id.

# if you want to discard changes in working copy, use checkout
# but REMEMBER! if file is staged, git checkout will NOT overwrite it!!!!
# SO, do unstaged file with (git reset HEAD file) before (git checkout -- file) to discard unexpected changes!!
git checkout -- file


========================================================================
at begining, HEAD --> master

git checkout -b dev	# create & switch to 'dev' branch
	git branch dev
	git checkout dev

git branch	# display branches

git checkout master
git merge dev	# merge dev to master, if no conflict, just move pointer, which is very fast!

# when github has no branch dev, git push will warn you and prompt with the correct cmd, which will create dev branch on github
$ git push
fatal: The current branch dev has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin dev

git branch -d dev	# delete branch dev, if already push dev to orgin, then you can still checkout dev from origin

# this is the merge result of modifications on master and dev!

git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit	# graph show, each one line, commit id abbrev.

git merge --no-ff dev	# explicitly noted no fast-forward

========================================================================

# NOTE: files not commited on dev branch(not staged(e.g. newly added) or even staged(i.e. added)) 
# will be visable by other branches(such as master). to avoid this:
# 1. 'git add' if not add to stage;
# 2. 'git stash' to temporarily store the state on dev branch;
# then you can switch to other branch with a clean working space, and do sth.(e.g. fix mergency bugs).
# after that, switch back to dev branch and 'git stash pop' to recover the state on dev branch

git checkout dev	# on dev branch
......			# newly add sth. or modify sth.  suppose it is NOT suitable to commit yet, but have to fix emergency bug on master
git add .		# add to stage first, otherwise they won't be stash
git stash		# save state, so that the modification is not visible to other branches.
git checkout master	# switch to other branch to fix emergency bug. w/o seeing the temporary modification on dev branch
......			# fixing on master
git checkout dev	# switching back to dev again
git stash pop		# recover the state previously saved, and continue work on dev branch.

# NOTE: although git stash can remember on which branch it's saved, you can pop it on any branch, so be careful!!!

========================================================================

git diff			# working copy vs. stage
git diff --staged filepath	# staged vs. head
git diff head filepath		# working copy vs. head
git diff commit-id filepath	# working copy vs. commit-id
git diff commit-id1 commit-id2
git diff head head~1		# head vs. 1 before head
git diff branchName filepath	# current branch vs. branchName


To remember the diff partner, imaging the chart below. [xx] mean the arg(i.e. 'git diff xx'), two parts are near the arrow <--->
	<-----------------------------> [head]
workingcopy		   staged	local repo.
	[noarg] <----->	 [--staged] <--->

team work:

git remote -v

member_new:
git clone git@github.com:tingdev/learngit.git		# oooops! only master branch is visible
git checkout -b dev origin/dev				# checkout orgin/dev to dev
git push origin dev

--about rebase -----------------------------------
# a good reference: http://gitbook.liuhui998.com/4_2.html
# 2 members dev on the 2 different branches

member 1 on branch a:
git push		# push with 2 commits

member 2 on branch b:
git push		# push with 2 commits.
* failed due		# usually you can git pull, git merge, git add, git commit, git push.
			# the version tree looks separated and then merged.
			# however, you can rebase
git rebase a		# 2 patches will be generated internally, and rebase to branch a, then apply 2 patches, 
			# and checkout branch b
			# if there's no conflict, it's done
* if there's conflict, fix it, git add, but do NOT git commit, and continue.
git rebase --continue	# continue


git rebase --abort	# you can abort at any time
========================================================================
# NOTE: git pull # ONLY pull current branch!!!!

tagging

git tag <tagname> [commit_id]  # tagging head or commit_id
git tag -a <tagname> -m "tag coments" [commit_id]      # same as above, w/ tag comments
git tag                                # show all tags briefly
git show <tagname>             # show a tag verbosely

git tag -d <tagname>

**** above tagging is only saved locally ****
git push origin <tagname>
git push origin --tags         # push all tags

git push origin :refs/tags/<tagname>   # delete remote tag after 'git tag -d x'
